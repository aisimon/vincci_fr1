Mobile Game Concepts: Year 2 & Year 3 (UK Curriculum)

This document outlines 10 mobile-first educational game themes designed for children aged 6–8. The focus is on tactile interactions (swiping, tapping, dragging) suitable for the iPhone 12 display.

🔡 English & Literacy Themes

1. The Spelling Safari

Curriculum Focus: Common Exception Words (Year 2/3 lists).

Theme: An off-road adventure through the jungle.

Gameplay: The player's jeep stops at a river. To build a bridge, they must catch "Letter-Butterflies" in the correct sequence to spell words like because, straight, and island.

Mobile Interaction: Tilt the phone to move the net and tap to catch letters.

2. Suffix Space Station

Curriculum Focus: Adding suffixes (-ing, -ed, -er, -est, -ly).

Theme: A futuristic rocket-building workshop.

Gameplay: A "Root Word" appears on a screen (e.g., copy). The player must choose the correct rule-module. To make copied, they must drag the "Change Y to I" tool before attaching the "-ed" engine.

Mobile Interaction: Drag-and-drop mechanics with haptic feedback when parts "snap" together.

3. Deep Sea Homophones

Curriculum Focus: Homophones and near-homophones (e.g., there/their/they’re, grate/great).

Theme: Exploration in a deep-sea submersible.

Gameplay: The sub's sonar displays a sentence with a gap: "I can ___ the ocean." Two glowing jellyfish float by, one labeled See and one labeled Sea. The player taps the correct one to power the sub’s lights.

Mobile Interaction: Quick-tap reflex gameplay.

4. The Magic Cauldron: Compound Words

Curriculum Focus: Vocabulary building and compound nouns.

Theme: A whimsical alchemy lab.

Gameplay: A recipe book asks for a "Blackbird." The player must find the "Black" ingredient and the "Bird" ingredient from a shelf of 10 items and toss them into a bubbling cauldron.

Mobile Interaction: Flicking gestures to "throw" items into the pot.

5. Punctuation Police

Curriculum Focus: Using apostrophes for possession and inverted commas for speech.

Theme: A "City Mystery" where signs and letters have lost their meaning.

Gameplay: A character says: Stop that thief! The player must drag "Speech Mark" handcuffs to the beginning and end of the sentence to "catch" the dialogue.

Mobile Interaction: Precise "pinpoint" tapping to place punctuation between letters.

🔢 Mathematics Themes

6. Pizza Parlour Fractions

Curriculum Focus: Simple fractions ($1/2$, $1/4$, $1/3$, $3/4$).

Theme: A high-speed Italian kitchen.

Gameplay: Customers order "3/4 Pepperoni, 1/4 Cheese." The player must use a virtual pizza cutter to slice the dough into four equal parts and then drag toppings to the correct sections.

Mobile Interaction: Multi-touch swiping to "cut" the pizza.

7. Number Bond Skyscrapers

Curriculum Focus: Recall of addition/subtraction facts to 20 and 100.

Theme: Constructing the London skyline.

Gameplay: A crane holds a block numbered "65." To place it, the player must tap the "Base Block" on the ground that completes the bond to 100 (in this case, "35").

Mobile Interaction: Vertical scrolling and rapid-fire tapping.

8. Clock Tower Time-Travel

Curriculum Focus: Telling the time to 5-minute intervals (past and to).

Theme: A magical clockmaker’s workshop.

Gameplay: A digital "Time Ticket" appears (e.g., 4:45). The player must manually rotate the physical hands of a giant analogue clock to match. If correct, the clock chimes and the player travels to a new historical era.

Mobile Interaction: Circular "rotary" touch gesture to move the clock hands.

9. Market Stall Multiplication

Curriculum Focus: 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, and 10 times tables.

Theme: A vibrant outdoor village market.

Gameplay: A customer asks for "5 bags of 4 oranges." The player must tap groups of 4 oranges to put them in bags, then calculate the total (20) to complete the sale.

Mobile Interaction: Grouping/clustering items by circling them with a finger.

10. The Great Shape Escape

Curriculum Focus: 2D/3D shapes, symmetry, and right angles.

Theme: An ancient tomb exploration.

Gameplay: To avoid a trap, the explorer must step only on shapes with "more than 4 vertices" or shapes with "at least one right angle."

Mobile Interaction: Path-drawing (tracing a line through the safe shapes).

Technical Recommendations for iPhone 12

Haptics: Use the Taptic Engine to provide a subtle "thud" for incorrect answers and a "sparkle" vibration for correct ones.

Safe Areas: Ensure all UI buttons are within the "Safe Area" to avoid the notch and the home indicator.

Short Sessions: Each level should last no more than 1–2 minutes to suit the attention span of 7-year-olds and the mobile "on-the-go" use case.
